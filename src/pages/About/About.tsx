        Let me take you back to 2014 when my health was so bad I couldnâ€™t even walk. And no, I am not exaggeratingâ€¦At age 22 I suffered from severe lower back pain that led to sciatica and an inability to stand up straight. I was bloated all the time, had low energy, and slept til noon. I used to be so addicted to sugar and sweets that I would binge an entire bag of twizzlers in one sitting! I couldn't cut the sugar fix and it left me feeling exhausted, inflamed, and sick.</p>

<p> My routine was inconsistent with bartending some days until 5am and other days waking up at 5am to go to auditions and casting calls. If I booked an acting job, I was out of the city for several weeks or months at a time. I didnâ€™t know how to balance health and fitness with my inconsistent and stressful schedule. I was miserable and didnâ€™t even fully know it. How it impacted the way I showed up in my career, my relationships, and my life, I thought that was how life was supposed to feel.</p>

<p> It took me YEARS to finally understand why I couldn't quit these habits. Finally Iâ€™d had enough, after a devastating breakup, I decided I needed to make a change. I couldnâ€™t live like this anymore. Iâ€™ve seen so many of my family, friends, and even myself struggle with fad diets and inconsistent workout routines, so I decided to become a Certified Personal Trainer, and eventually a Certified Nutrition Coach. It was important for me to take a different approach within the health and fitness industry. The only time Iâ€™ve seen true success in health and fitness is by developing habits, creating a routine, and making fitness a LIFESTYLE!</p>

          <p> I went on to pursue my Master's degree in Exercise Science and Nutrition and now have 
      over seven years of experience training clients virtually and in-person. With certifications 
          in strength and conditioning, nutrition coaching, corrective exercise, and performance enhancement, 
          I specialize in helping people build strength, lose fat, and feel their bestâ€”without spending hours in the gym.
