          Meet <span className="amanda">Amanda</span> <span className="jane">Jane</span>: Your Guide To Strength & Confidence
        </h1>
        <p>
          Let me take you back to 2014 when my health was so bad I couldnâ€™t even walk...
        </p>

        <p>
          I went on to pursue my Master's degree in Exercise Science and Nutrition and now have 
          over seven years of experience training clients virtually and in-person. With certifications 
          in strength and conditioning, nutrition coaching, corrective exercise, and performance enhancement, 
          I specialize in helping people build strength, lose fat, and feel their bestâ€”without spending hours in the gym.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're overwhelmed by fitness advice, struggling with motivation, or just donâ€™t know where to start, 
          let me guide you through the essentialsâ€”goal setting, realistic habits, nutrition insights, and strength 
          trainingâ€”to help you achieve long-term results.
        </p>
